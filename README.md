-----------------------------------------------

Try as I may, I have not been able to get the Objective-C++ bridge between the C++ core library and
the Objective-C API working. Despite what the documentation says, I have not been able to catch C++
exceptions in Objective-C++ code and rethrow them as Objective-C exceptions. The exceptions are simply
not caught, and the program aborts.

If anyone has any solutions, I'm open to suggestions.
